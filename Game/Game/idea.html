            <strong> The idea </strong> 
            <br>
            In this game, the player must bomb a bandit to defeat him. However, the game tricks the player by making them think they should click on hearts, which is what they're used to doing in other games to gain health points.        
            <strong>The bandit </strong>is represented by an image on the screen. The player will see a series of hearts and bombs on the screen, and they will be instructed to click on the hearts to gain health points. However, some of the hearts will be replaced by bombs.
            If the player clicks on a bomb, it will explode and damage the player's health. If they click on a heart, their health will be restored. The objective is to correctly identify and click on the hearts while avoiding the bombs, in order to bomb the bandit and defeat him.</p>
